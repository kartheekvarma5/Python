name(5) // Out is B // name(-6) is O //
 
name[0:2] => YO || name[1:4] ==> OUT ||name[1:] ==> YOUTUBE ||name[:4] ==> YOUT 
name[3:10] ==> TUBE (no errors will come since if we just use outof bounds we get error here in this case we dont get)

Strings in Python are immutable.

'my ' + name[3:] ==> my tube
to check length of the string
len(name)
================================================
#How can you create a variable with val 0 without loading a value to it.
Use Below

var1 = int()
This above will make var1 as 0 . since int() is 0.
Same refers for below.
var2 = float()
o/p is 0.0
var3 = bool()
o/p is false
var4 = complex()
o/p is 0j

#for bool what ever the input which you give , if it is not zero it displays o/p as True) if it is 0 it shows false.
bool(0)
False
bool(0.1)	#Here even it is 0.1 it shows True.
True
bool(-1) for Minus values also it gives True
True

For all basic data types (int, float, bool, complex) length function(len()) will not work.

When ever the len() function words then we will have 4 conditions to check. That means 4 concepts we will get.

1) indexing
	a) Forward indexing
**	b) reverse indexing	(myvar="good morning" | myvar[::-1] | o/p is 'gninrom doog'
	Few Points:
	a) TO print the last value we can use this : var[ len(var) - 1 ].  This prints the last value using forwards direction method. If wanted we can use var[-1] using reverse indexing method.
	b) TO print the first value we can use var[0] in forward indexing. in reverse we can use like var[-len(var)].
	c) var[3+2-5] here it is like var[0] which means we are saying to print the first digit

2) slicing
	var[0:10:0] Here the last value "0" cannnot be 0. Because it is slice step which cannot be zero. It should be 1 or more aprt from 0. You will get error if you do it. Becaue if you put 0 . that means it will be there in the first place only.
	if you give starting value as outside index value. in slicing you will not get error you will just get the null/empty o/p.

	Ex : A='python'
	A[100:200:1] --> o/p is ''
	For example what happens if we put outside index value for end value?
	Ex:A[4,300,1] , The End value is taken max even python string is 6 and you will get expected o/p.
	A[::] this will display full o/p
	in slicing end value is displayed as end-1. Just check one example.[Same as index in forward direction]

	Forward Slicing
	----------------
	Method1:
	K='WHAT IS YOUR NAME'
	K[Start:End:Step]
	K[SmallNo:LargeNo:+1]

3) item-assighnment

4) mutable or immutable
